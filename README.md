I will be using an mlb dataset from kaggles that has complete game data for four mlb seasons. I will choose ten specific players, five batters and five pitchers. FOr the batters I will use the data to calculate and predict a homerun rate, a clutch score, and classify the players star potential.
For the pitchers, I will calculate their dominance, predict an earned run average, and classify their status as an ace based on their stats.
